With the addition of labels from supervised data sets which have noise, the bootstrap file creation is separated into bio and phi to avoid influence of non-core entity types of a model from overwhelming core entity types


Also one thing that supervised data sets do is bring in adjective terms. This is one more reason to separate the list for different models


to generate bootstrap entities for bio models
./gen_bs.sh bio_list.txt 


For non bio
./gen_bs.sh phi_list.txt 



Then use the output  bootstrap_entities.txt to cluster and magnify the labeled terms to other terms.
